# 🚗🔋 Digital Twin Model: Evaluating the Sustainability of Autonomous Vehicle Adoption

This project presents a **system dynamics digital twin model** developed using **Vensim PLE** to analyze whether the increasing adoption of **Autonomous Vehicles (AVs)** is sustainable in terms of electricity consumption, renewable energy capacity, and lithium resource availability.

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) are poised to revolutionize transportation. However, their rapid adoption raises sustainability concerns:
- ⚡ Surging electricity demand
- 🔋 Lithium shortages for batteries
- 🌿 Increased pressure on renewable infrastructure

> **Key Question**: *Is the mass adoption of AVs environmentally and infrastructurally sustainable over time?*

## 🔁 Feedback Loops

| Loop Type       | Description                                                                 |
|------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Reinforcing (R1)** | More AVs → More electricity demand → More renewable investment → More capacity → Enables more AVs |
| **Balancing (B1)**   | More AVs → Higher lithium demand → Shortage → Limits future adoption     |
| **Balancing (B2)**   | Higher AV share → Market saturation/resistance → Slows new adoption     |
