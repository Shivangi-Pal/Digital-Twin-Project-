# Digital Twin Model: Evaluating the Sustainability of Autonomous Vehicle Adoption

This project presents a system dynamics digital twin model developed using Vensim PLE to analyze whether the increasing adoption of Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) is sustainable in terms of electricity consumption, renewable capacity, and lithium resource availability.

## Problem Statement
Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) are expected to transform transportation. However, the rapid adoption of AVs brings concerns over:

Increased electricity demand

Lithium shortages for batteries

Pressure on renewable energy infrastructure

This model addresses the question:

❓ Is the mass adoption of AVs environmentally and infrastructurally sustainable over time?

## GML Framework (Goals, Measures, Levers)

Element	Description
Goals	Assess long-term sustainability of AV adoption across energy and resource dimensions
Measures	No. of AVs, Electricity Demand, Installed Renewable Capacity, Lithium Shortage Ratio
Levers	Government Incentives, Charging Infrastructure, AV Tech Advancement Rate, Renewable Growth Rate
## Model Architecture
The model is divided into three subsystems:
Each component interacts with feedback loops and external drivers.

1. 🚘 AV Adoption Subsystem
Stock: No. of AVs

Flows: AV adoption rate, AV retirement rate

Drivers:

AV attractiveness factor (affected by incentives, infrastructure, tech rate)

Market resistance

Adoption saturation

Key Output: AV market share over time

2. ⚡ Electricity Demand & Renewable Supply
Stock: Installed renewable capacity

Flows:

Renewable capacity addition rate

Renewable decommission rate

Calculated Outputs:

Electricity demand from AVs

Total electricity demand

Renewable supply gap

Levers:

Effect of AVs on investment in renewables

Base renewable growth rate

3. 🔋 Lithium Resource Subsystem
Computed Variables:

Annual lithium demand = AVs × lithium per battery

Shortage ratio = Demand / Supply

Impacts:

Lithium shortage can act as a braking feedback loop on AV production (optional modeling extension).

🔁 Key Feedback Loops

Loop Type	Description
Reinforcing (R1)	AV adoption → ↑ Electricity demand → ↑ Renewable investment → ↑ Installed capacity → Supports more AVs
Balancing (B1)	↑ AVs → ↑ Lithium demand → Supply pressure → Shortage → ↓ AV production
Balancing (B2)	↑ AV market share → Market resistance/adoption saturation → ↓ adoption rate
📈 Simulation Insights (Sample Outcomes)
What level of renewable energy growth is needed to keep pace with AV electricity demand?

How does policy intervention (incentives or tech investment) affect sustainability?

What is the tipping point where lithium shortages slow down adoption?
