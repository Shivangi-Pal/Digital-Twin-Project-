#  Digital Twin Model: Evaluating the Sustainability of Autonomous Vehicle Adoption

This project presents a **system dynamics digital twin model** developed using **Vensim PLE** to analyze whether the increasing adoption of **Autonomous Vehicles (AVs)** is sustainable in terms of electricity consumption, renewable energy capacity, and lithium resource availability.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Problem Statement

Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) are poised to revolutionize transportation. However, their rapid adoption raises sustainability concerns:
-  Surging electricity demand
-  Lithium shortages for batteries
-  Increased pressure on renewable infrastructure

> **Key Question**: *Is the mass adoption of AVs environmentally and infrastructurally sustainable over time?*

| Loop Type       | Description                                                                 |
|------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Reinforcing (R1)** | More AVs â†’ More electricity demand â†’ More renewable investment â†’ More capacity â†’ Enables more AVs |
| **Balancing (B1)**   | More AVs â†’ Higher lithium demand â†’ Shortage â†’ Limits future adoption     |
| **Balancing (B2)**   | Higher AV share â†’ Market saturation/resistance â†’ Slows new adoption     |
