# Digital Twin Project

# Overview
This project presents a System Dynamics-based Digital Twin developed using Vensim PLE, designed to analyze the sustainability of Autonomous Vehicle (AV) adoption with a focus on its impact on electricity demand and renewable energy supply. The model simulates the interaction between AV market growth, electricity consumption, and the capacity of renewable energy infrastructure, providing insights into achieving sustainability goals.

# Objectives
G1: Analyze the impact of AV adoption on total electricity demand.

G2: Assess the capability of renewable energy infrastructure to meet the new demand introduced by AVs.

# Model Description
The model is structured around key feedback loops that drive the dynamics of AV adoption and renewable energy expansion. The system includes:

Stocks:

Number of AVs

Installed Renewable Capacity

Total Electricity Demand

Flows:

AV Adoption Rate

AV Retirement Rate

Renewable Capacity Addition

Capacity Decommissioning Rate

Converters & Parameters:

Government incentives

Charging infrastructure support

Policy support for renewables

Average AV energy efficiency

Renewable plant lifespan

Market share and total vehicle market

AV attractiveness and technology advancement

# Key Levers
Government incentives for AV adoption

Investment in charging infrastructure

Policy support for renewable energy expansion

Setting AV energy efficiency standards

# Key Output Metrics
Total energy consumed by AVs over time

Percentage of AV charging powered by renewables

Renewable energy supply-demand gap

AV market penetration over time

# Insights & Use Cases
Supports policy planning by simulating how different incentives and regulations influence AV adoption and renewable energy development.

Identifies thresholds where AV growth may outpace renewable capacity, leading to unsustainable energy demand.

Helps in strategic infrastructure investment decisions by tracking renewable capacity expansion needs.

# Tools Used
